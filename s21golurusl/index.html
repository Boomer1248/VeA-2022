					<p><em><b>Family Guy</b></em> is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian.</p>
					
					<p>Set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, the show exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>
					
					<p><em><b>Family Guy's</b></em> cancellation was announced shortly after the third season had aired in 2002, with one unaired episode eventually premiering on Adult Swim in 2003, finishing the series' original run.</p>
					
					<p>Favorable DVD sales and high ratings from syndicated reruns since then convinced Fox to revive the show in 2004; a fourth season would begin airing the following year on May 1, 2005.</p>

						<h3>Peter</h3>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c2/Peter_Griffin.png" alt="Peter">
						<p>Peter Griffin is the father of the Griffin family, a stereotypical blue-collar worker. Peter is also an obese and bespectacled man who is just a big child. Peter discovered his low intellect falls slightly below the level for mental retardation after taking an I.Q. test, which places his I.Q. at around 70. Peter is known for his brash impulsiveness, which has led to several awkward situations.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="related-panel">
						<h3>Lois</h3>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Lois_Griffin.png" alt="Lois">
						<p>Lois Griffin is the mother of the Griffin family. Lois's morals are often questionable, as she went through a brief period of kleptomania, for which she went to prison. She is commonly the voice of reason to Peter's shenanigans, but in some episodes she can act darker than normal and sometimes shows a taste for sadomasochism.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="related-panel">
						<h3>Meg</h3>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c7/Meg_Griffin.png" alt="Meg">
						<p>Meg Griffin is a self-conscious and emotionally vulnerable teenage girl, daughter of Peter and Lois. She is currently 18 years old and enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. Her numerous insecurities cause her to desperately try to be part of the "in-crowd". While Meg is usually a pushover, she can get angry when pushed too far, though such occasions are usually rare.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="related-panel">
						<h3>Chris</h3>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Chris_Griffin.png" alt="Chris">
						<p>Chris Griffin is a friendly and laid-back teenage boy, son of Peter and Lois. Similar to Meg, Chris is a typical adolescent, albeit one who comes off as being good-natured and easy-going. As such, he tends to take things in his stride, not worrying about much, seemingly enjoying his position in life.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="related-panel">
						<h3>Stewie</h3>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/Stewie_Griffin.png" alt="Stewie">
						<p>Stewie Griffin is the youngest Griffin family member at one year old, son of Peter and Lois. Stewie originally served as the main villain of the show. Though he was originally an antagonistic child-genius sociopath, hell-bent on killing his mother and taking over the world, in more recent episodes he is a much more friendly yet flamboyant character, though nonetheless still rambunctious and disrespecting towards his elders and peers.</p>
