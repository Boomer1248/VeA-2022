            <em>Age of Empires II</em> Age of Empires II is a real-time strategy game
            that focuses on building towns, gathering resources, and creating armies to defeat opponents.
            Players conquer rival towns and empires as they advance one of 13 civilizations through four "Ages":
            the Dark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle Age (representing the High Middle Ages),
            and the Imperial Age (reminiscent of the Renaissance)—a 1,000-year timeframe.
            Advancing to a new Age unlocks new units, structures, and technologies,
            but players must first build certain buildings from their current age
            and then pay a sum of resources (typically food and gold).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Age of Kings also includes five types of military units:
            infantry, archers, cavalry, siege weapons, and naval units. Certain types of infantry,
            archers, and cavalry are "counter units" with special defenses against other types of units.
            The three human classes of military generally follow a rock-paper-scissors model.
            For example, infantry are generally powerful against buildings but weak against cavalry,
            thus the infantry counter units—spearmen and pikemen—have attack bonuses against cavalry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buildings in The Age of Kings are split into economic and military categories.
            Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic,
            military, or unit-based efficiency, as well as provide resources for the player.
          </p>
