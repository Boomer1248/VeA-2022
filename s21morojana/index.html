                    <p>The everyday lives of workers at a paper company are caught on camera by a camera crew for a documentary. Some of these workers are <em>Michael Scott</em>, the boss, who isn't too bright or funny. <em>Dwight Shrute</em>, a salesman who takes his job very, very, seriously. <em>Jim Halpert</em>, a salesman who is the office cool guy and prankster. And <em>Pam Beesly</em>, the receptionist who is engaged but who is also the crush of someone else in the office. With these characters, the daily antics of this branch is anything but normal.</p>
                    <p>As this mockumentary follows the everyday lives of the manager and the employees he "manages." The crew follows the employees around 24/7 and captures their quite humorous and bizarre encounters as they will do what it takes to keep the company thriving.</p>
