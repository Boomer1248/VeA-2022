            <p><em>Porsche 911</em>  Carrera 2 (1990) Shows Stunning Forest Green Metallic Look</p>
            <p>Porsche’s 964 series of the 911 might go down in history for a couple of things – it was the first generation of the famous German sports car to make use of the company’s signature Tiptronic automatic transmission and an optional all-wheel drive setup. But for some it might also go down in popular culture because of its appetence for unusual colors – and this 1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 is a perfect example of the latter.</p>
            <p>Exactly three decades old, the 964 unit is part of the lineup of 234 cars currently set to go down under the (virtual) hammer at the upcoming September Live Online Auction event organized by Classic Car Auctions (CCA).</p>

            <p>Each new iteration of 911 was internally codenamed with a letter of the alphabet, but it wasn’t until reaching G that there was a discernable difference in styling and tech, and the dawn of a new generation. The G-Series ran for a long time, too, debuting in 1973 and only being replaced in 1989. The most significant move made in this time was the introduction of turbocharging to the 911, the Turbo you see above arriving in 1975 with a mighty 260bhp powering the rear wheels. Back then, though, turbochargers were saved for only the fastest 911s...</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Following such a loved generation of car, the 1998 arrival of the water-cooled 996 was met with grumbles and cries of 'it’s lost its character', something of a running theme for new-generation 911s and the implacable Porsche aficionados they’ve tried to please. Those nonplussed by the change in hardware were probably upset by the looks, the 911 gaining its first major styling change, not dissimilar to the cheaper Boxster and notable for its – shock horror! – non-elliptical headlights. The 996 also marked the exponential growth in 911 variants, but when that also goes hand-in-hand with the first ever GT3 being launched, that’s far from bad news.</p>

            <p>The 991 arrived in 2011, and while it may have been coined the prettiest 911 in decades, nothing could save it from a wrath of criticism for its new electric steering. Still, there’s been plenty to distract from that, with an amazingly new round-edged GT car character in the regular Carrera models, and a new level of savagery with the bonkers GT3 RS. The Targa is also cool again. It will go down in history as the last of the 911s to have naturally aspirated Carreras that rev to the heavens…</p>
